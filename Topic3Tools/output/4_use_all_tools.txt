User: Can you count the number of times 's' and 'i' each appear in 'Mississippi riverboats'; Then subtract the counts; Then covert the difference into speech?

--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM wants to call 2 tool(s)
  Tool: count_letter
  Args: {'payload': '{"letter":"s","text":"Mississippi riverboats"}'}
  Result: {"success": true, "result": 5}
  Tool: count_letter
  Args: {'payload': '{"letter":"i","text":"Mississippi riverboats"}'}
  Result: {"success": true, "result": 5}

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM wants to call 1 tool(s)
  Tool: calculator
  Args: {'payload': '{"expression": "5 - 5"}'}
  Result: {"success": true, "result": 0}

--- Iteration 3 ---
LLM wants to call 1 tool(s)
  Tool: text_to_speech
  Args: {'payload': '{"text":"The difference is zero."}'}
  Result: {"success": true}

--- Iteration 4 ---
Assistant: I counted the letters in "Mississippi riverboats": 's' appears 5 times and 'i' appears 5 times. The difference between the counts is 0. I have converted this result into speech: "The difference is zero."
