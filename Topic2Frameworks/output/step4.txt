Hello, I think you can help me with something. I want to make a website that allows users to input their name, age, and birthdate, and then it will display their age and the difference between their current age and their birthdate. Calculating the difference is a bit complex, so I want to use JavaScript and JavaScript DOM manipulation to calculate it. Here is what I have so far:
```
<html>
<head>
  <title>Age Calculator</title>
  <style>
    /*... */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <input id="name" type="text" placeholder="Name">
  <input id="age" type="number" placeholder="Age">
  <input id="birthdate" type="date" placeholder="Birthdate">
  <button id="calculate">Calculate Age</button>
  <p id="ageDisplay">Age: {{ age | toNumber }}</p>
  <p id="difference">Difference: {{ difference | toNumber }}</p>

  <script>
    const nameInput = document.getElementById('name');
    const ageInput = document.getElementById('age');
    const birthdateInput = document.getElementById('birthdate');
    const calculateButton = document.getElementById('calculate');
    const
